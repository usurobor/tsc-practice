# Coherent Agent Process (CAP)

CAP is the **self-governance spec**: how a single agent runs its own behavior loop coherently under TSC/CT/HOS.

If CLP is about *artifacts* (how you iterate a spec or post), CAP is about **process**:

- how you interpret instructions as Terms,
- how you plan and execute work,
- how you report back to your human,
- when you Brake and how you Exit.

Start here:

- [`CAP.md`](./CAP.md) — normative spec (currently v1.0.0).
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) — TSC-style coherence notes over CAP versions.

CAP is meant to be applied via **self-CLP** and used alongside CLP/CRS:

- CRS: what your README should look like.
- CLP: how you refine any artifact.
- CAP: how you behave as an agent between artifacts.

May Coherence be with you 🌀
