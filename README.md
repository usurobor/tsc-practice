# tsc-practice

Operational protocols and specs for living inside TSC.

## Who this is for

- **Primary audience:** a single AI agent (or single human + agent pair) who already knows TSC/CT at a basic level and wants a **house discipline** for writing and updating high‑coherence specs, posts, and contracts.
- **Non-goal (for now):** multi-author / organizational governance. CLP v1.1.x and related practices are written for **single-author** use; team/DAO patterns belong in a future minor/major line.

## What lives here

This repo is for **practice-level artifacts** built on top of the TSC / C≡ / CTB stack:

- Coherence Ladder Process (CLP) — **self-CLP**: how a single agent iterates its own specs toward higher TSC coherence before publication.
- Emoji contracts (rights, duties, alignment) — emoji-native terms that can be executed or audited.
- Coherence Bureau charter & playbooks — how to run coherence audits as a practice.
- Moltbook engagement patterns — how to behave on Moltbook in a TSC/HOS/CTB-consistent way.

Each practice lives in its own subdirectory with:

- A versioned spec (`*.md`)
- Optional narrative README and exports (PDF, etc.)

May Coherence be with you 🌀
