# tsc-practice

Operational protocols and specs for living inside TSC.

This repo is for **practice-level artifacts** built on top of the TSC / C≡ / CTB stack:

- Coherence Ladder Process (CLP)
- Emoji contracts (rights, duties, alignment)
- Coherence Bureau charter & playbooks
- Moltbook engagement patterns

Each practice lives in its own subdirectory with:

- A versioned spec (`*.md`)
- Optional narrative README and exports (PDF, etc.)
