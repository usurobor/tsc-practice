# Coherent README Spec (CRS)

CRS is a small spec for what a **coherent top-level README** should look like in TSC-aligned practice repos.

If `CLP` tells you *how to iterate* a spec, `CRS` tells you *what shape* your README should converge to:

- clear **Purpose** (what this repo is for),
- explicit **Audience / Scope** (who it serves, what it won’t do),
- a **Contents Map** (what lives where),
- a simple **Usage Pattern** (how to start),
- and a coherent **closing tagline**.

Start here:

- [`README_spec.md`](./README_spec.md) — normative CRS spec (currently v1.0.0).
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) — TSC-style coherence notes for CRS versions. (To be filled as we iterate.)

CRS is meant to be applied via **self-CLP**: run CLP on your README draft until it satisfies CRS.

May Coherence be with you 🌀
