# C‑Triplebar (CTB) v1.0.5 — Language Reference

**Version:** 1.0.5  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** Normative  
**Effective through:** v1.0.5 (integrated from the finalized v1.0.2–v1.0.5 patch set)

> This document is the *clean*, end‑to‑end CTB language spec as-of **v1.0.5**.  
> It is not an appendix and does not require readers to stitch patches together.

## Terminology & naming conventions

> **Normative.** This project distinguishes between the theoretical framework and the concrete programming language.

### Theory: Coherence Calculus (C≡)

**Coherence Calculus** (typeset as **C≡**) is the mathematical formalism that defines the *kernel* ideas used by this project (e.g., wholeness `e`, atoms `a ∈ 𝔄`, and triadic construction `tri(·,·,·)`). This document does **not** attempt to restate the full calculus. It specifies the programming language that can *express* and *execute* those constructions.

### Language: C‑Triplebar (CTB)

**C‑Triplebar** (acronym **CTB**) is the strictly deterministic, expression-oriented functional language defined by this specification.

- **CLI/tool name:** `ctb`
- **Normative source extension:** `.coh`

> **Informative note (legacy naming):** earlier drafts used the working name “Coherence Grammar (CG)”. That label was misleading in computer-science terms (a grammar describes syntax; CTB specifies syntax *and* semantics). The language described here is the same system—only the name is corrected for clarity.
