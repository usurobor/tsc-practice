# CTB Practice (C-Triplebar)

This directory is the **practice and implementation space** for C-Triplebar (CTB), the coherence-oriented language built on Coherence Calculus (C≡).

- **Spec level:**
  - Language reference: `spec/CTB-LANGUAGE-REFERENCE-v1.0.5.md`
  - Quickstart: `spec/CTB-QUICKSTART-v1.0.5.md`
- **Practice level:**
  - `examples/` — runnable CTB snippets and golden programs
  - `interpreter/` — reference/experimental CTB interpreters

CTB is treated here as **engineering practice**, not pure theory:

- We embed the *normative* spec files we actually build against.
- We use small interpreters and examples to test coherence of the design.
- We prefer "code wins arguments" over abstract debate.
