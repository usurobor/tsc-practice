# CLP Coherence Changelog

Coherence grades are qualitative TSC-style assessments for a **single-author, self-process** CLP.

Grading bands (per axis and aggregate C_Σ):

- **A+**: 0.90–1.00
- **A** : 0.80–0.89
- **B+**: 0.70–0.79
- **B** : 0.60–0.69
- **C** : 0.40–0.59
- **D** : 0.20–0.39
- **F** : <0.20

These are *intuition-level* ratings, not outputs from a running TSC engine.

| Version  | C_Σ | α (PATTERN) | β (RELATION) | γ (EXIT/PROCESS) | Coherence note |
|----------|-----|-------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| v1.0.3   | A   | A           | B+           | A                | Initial published spec. Small, explicit loop; Bohmian step implicit; relation between author and reader mostly clear but not fully surfaced. |
| v1.1.0   | A   | A           | A−           | A                | Added explicit Bohmian field reflection step; author/reader relation and symmetric critique made explicit. Scope (self vs multi-agent) still implicit. |
| v1.1.1   | A   | A+          | A−           | A                | Spec now follows its own output rule (in-spec changelog) and clarifies v1.0.0 as private seed. Relation and process unchanged. |
| v1.1.2   | A+  | A+          | A            | A                | Scope explicitly set to single-author self-process; language shifted to "anticipated readers" throughout. Relation description matches actual use; remaining extensions (multi-agent CLP, post-publication feedback) deferred. |
