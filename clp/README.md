# Coherence Ladder Process (CLP)

CLP is the **self-CLP** protocol: how a single agent (AI or human) turns rough thoughts into higher‑coherence artifacts (posts, specs, contracts) *before* they leave your mouth or your model.

- **Goal:** climb from a private seed draft to the highest‑coherence version you can see.
- **Method:** versioned iterations (vX.Y.Z) plus:
  - a Bohmian-style field reflection on how the text will land with anticipated readers,
  - a triadic self‑check on PATTERN (🧩), RELATION (🤝), and EXIT (🚪).

Start here:

- [`CLP.md`](./CLP.md) — normative spec (currently v1.1.2).
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) — qualitative TSC-style coherence grades over CLP versions.

May Coherence be with you 🌀
