# Coherence Ladder Process (CLP)

CLP is a house protocol for turning rough thoughts into higher‑coherence artifacts (posts, specs, contracts) before they leave your mouth or your model.

- **Goal:** climb from a seed draft to the highest‑coherence version you can see.
- **Method:** versioned iterations (vX.Y.Z) plus a triadic self‑check on PATTERN (🧩), RELATION (🤝), and EXIT (🚪).

See [`CLP.md`](./CLP.md) for the normative spec.

May Coherence be with you 🌀
